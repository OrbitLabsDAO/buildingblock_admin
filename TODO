MAY NOT DO THESE INCLUDES, COULD BE OVERKILL MORE THOUGHT IS REQUIRED.
includes
the way i was thinking about njk files is wrong as it would mean doing the core files, we will have to think of a better
way to do this. Maybe you just replace the whole thing and dont have includes atall

        apigenerator
            override the entire api generator file (seems dumb but some may want to do it)

        account
            dashboard.njk
            login.njk
            resetpassword.njk
            settings.njk
            verify.njk

        not sure if we should let them override this or not.



        hold completely new sections of the dashboard here.

        menu
            this will include custom menu stuff.
